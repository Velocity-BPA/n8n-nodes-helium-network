# Automate Your Helium Network Operations with Our New n8n Community Node

We're excited to announce that Velocity BPA has released a new community node for n8n that brings the power of the Helium Network directly into your automation workflows!

## What is the Helium Network?

Helium is the world's largest decentralized wireless network, powering IoT devices and 5G connectivity through a revolutionary DePIN (Decentralized Physical Infrastructure Network) model. With thousands of hotspots worldwide, Helium enables device connectivity while rewarding network participants with cryptocurrency tokens.

## The Challenge

Managing Helium hotspots, tracking rewards, monitoring network performance, and participating in governance typically requires jumping between multiple platforms and manual processes. For businesses running multiple hotspots or building IoT solutions on Helium, this creates operational overhead and limits scalability.

## Introducing n8n-nodes-helium-network

Our new community node bridges the gap between Helium Network and n8n's powerful automation platform. Now you can:

- **Monitor Hotspot Performance**: Automatically track your hotspot status, earnings, and network activity
- **Manage Rewards**: Set up workflows to monitor HNT/IOT/MOBILE token rewards and trigger actions based on earnings thresholds
- **Automate Governance**: Stay informed about network proposals and participate in decentralized governance
- **IoT Device Management**: Integrate Helium-connected devices into broader automation workflows
- **Custom Alerts**: Build notification systems for hotspot issues, reward milestones, or network changes

## Real-World Use Cases

Imagine automatically sending daily performance reports to stakeholders, triggering maintenance alerts when hotspot connectivity drops, or integrating Helium data with your business intelligence dashboards—all without writing complex code.

## Getting Started

Installation is simple. In your n8n instance, run:


npm install n8n-nodes-helium-network


Then restart n8n, and you'll find the Helium Network node available in your node palette.

## Open Source and Community-Driven

This node is open source and available on GitHub at https://github.com/Velocity-BPA/n8n-nodes-helium-network. We welcome contributions, feature requests, and feedback from the community.
